🛍️ Amazon E-Commerce Recommendation System Using Content-Based Filtering
🌟 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an effective recommendation system for e-commerce platforms like Amazon, addressing the common problem of irrelevant product suggestions that can lead to customer drop-off. The primary goal is to recommend users a list of similar products in the same category based on the current product they are browsing. By understanding and leveraging consumer preferences, the system aims to improve customer retention and increase the likelihood of item purchases.

The main focus of this analysis is a Content-Based Filtering approach.

🎯 Objectives
The core objective is:

To recommend users a list of similar products in the same category based on the current product they are browsing.

💡 Methods Explored

Recommendation System Type	Target/Scenario
Part I: Product Popularity Based System	Targeted at new customers who lack purchase history.
Part II: Model-Based Collaborative Filtering System	Based on a customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought similar items.
Part III: Content-Based Filtering (Main Focus)	Used when a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time without any product rating (or when recommending similar items).# Recommender-system-project
